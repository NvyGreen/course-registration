# Course Registration
This project is a demo course registration application, specifically developed and designed for UC Irvine. The application is a simulation of real-world course registration in universities, where students can view and organize their schedules in an efficient, user-friendly, and organized manner.

The objective of this project is to illustrate important constraints of academic registration systems like student registration limits, waiting lists, or scheduling, as well as basic web application concepts like user interactions, data validation, and state management on the server.

This repository acts as a functional prototype; it is not a production-ready system.


## Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML/CSS
Backend: Python (Flask)
Database: MySQL


## Features
Through this platform, users can:
* Browse available courses and view detailed course information
* Filter courses based on specified criteria (e.g., department or availability)
* Register for and drop classes in real time
* Join waitlists for courses that have reached capacity


## Running Locally
To run this project locally:
1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Create a .env file in the root directory.
3. Add your database connection details and a secret key to the .env file for secure access.
4. Start the Flask server and access the application through your browser.


## Future Improvements
* Improve overall UI/UX and visual design
* Prevent students from registering for multiple courses in the same time slot
* Enforce prerequisite and corequisite checks during registration
* Add authentication and student-specific dashboards
